This repo is where I do practice problems from [Exercism](https://exercism.org).

## Why I Like Exercism

Exercsism is a coding practice site like hackerrank, leetcode, codesignal, etc. Here are some things that set exercism apart:

- Mentoring: You can request someone look at your solution and give you feedback.
- CLI: Exercism has a command line interface, which makes it easier to adhere to standard software development practices
  - Use git and GitHub to version control and document your solutions (like what I'm doing here)
  - Benefit from all the features of a fully featured IDE, like intellisense and automatic linting (I use VS Code)
  - test-driven development using standard tools (e.g. pytest)
