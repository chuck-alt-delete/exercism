# Criticisms of this exercise 
## by Chuck

- Can't hands be more than 2 cards? The way I play Blackjack, you are dealt two cards, and can continue to hit until you stay or bust. This affects the `value_of_ace` function because the input should be my entire hand, not just my initial hand.
- This exercise would benefit a lot from using classes and looking at python's `__gt__` dunder method
